<p id="about-me">
 My name is David Segura and I am a 30-year-old creator, photographer, and social media manager with a passion for cars. I got my start in the automotive industry by taking up photography eight years ago and sharing my work on social media. As a social media manager, I develop strategies, create content, engage with followers, and track metrics for myself and my clients. My photography skills have allowed me to capture stunning images of cars, build a strong social media following, and establish myself as a respected figure in the car community. With my keen eye for photography and design, I have built a solid reputation and established relationships with companies in the automotive industry. This led me to pursue event coordination, where I found success in bringing together car enthusiasts, vendors, and spectators for memorable shows. My attention to detail and organizational skills make me a valuable asset in planning and executing successful events. My passion for cars, talent for photography and design, and expertise in event coordination and social media management make me a unique and valuable figure in the automotive industry. I am dedicated to continuing my growth and development in these areas and to creating unforgettable experiences for car enthusiasts and spectators alike.
